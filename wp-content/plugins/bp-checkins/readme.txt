BuddyPress 1.5+ plugin to add checkins to profile or group updates.

== Description ==

BP Checkins is a plugin that uses HTML5 Geolocation API to add checkins to BuddyPress profile or group updates

Once activated, a location marker in the top right of the activity status box will show. On click, the browser will prompt the user for permission before detecting and braodcasting the location.
Once the check-in is posted to the activity stream, it will have its own permalink. On click, it will position the user on a map.
Members can also visit each other’s profiles to see a map of the user’s checkins at the top of the page.

This is the beta version of the plugin.
